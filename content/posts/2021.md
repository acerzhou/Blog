G'Day Mate.

This is Acer Zhou, welcome to my personal blog space [Acer's Note](http://acerzhou.info/Blog/).

I have been thinking to create a blog for a long long time, but never commit to it.

This time, I'd like to give it a try and put some effort here, to create a space recording and sharing the journey I have been through.

Currently, for this site, I am going to focus on but not limited to following content:

- Diary & Casual thinking
- Tech & Programming
- Some Useful Resources

I hope I can take this on, and make it become a small conner on the Internet.
And most important, hope you enjoy it. :)

Let's rock, 2021 !
